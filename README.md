# 🏎️ Real-time Ride-matching System Project – Overview

The **Ride Matching Project** is a **real-time ride-hailing system** designed to connect passengers with nearby drivers efficiently, similar to platforms like Uber or Ola. This project demonstrates how to structure complex applications using **Clean Architecture** and **Dependency Injection (DI)** so that the core business logic stays independent of frameworks, databases, or messaging systems.

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

1. **Real-time ride matching** – Find the nearest available driver for a passenger request.
2. **Scalable architecture** – Easily add features like surge pricing, driver ratings, and promotions without breaking core logic.
3. **Testable & maintainable code** – Use dependency injection to swap infrastructure (DB, cache, messaging) for tests or future enhancements.
4. **Event-driven extensibility** – Support async events like ride status updates or notifications using Kafka or Redis Pub/Sub.

## 🔑 Key Features

- Request a ride and get matched with the closest driver.
- Track rides and drivers in real-time.
- Plug-and-play infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, etc.).
- Unit-testable domain logic with in-memory repositories.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Example)

- **Backend:** Node.js / TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geospatial queries
- **Cache / Pub-Sub:** Redis
- **Messaging:** Kafka
- **DI Framework:** Inversify.js (for clean dependency management)
- **Testing:** Jest with in-memory repositories

---

## 💡 Why It’s Useful

- Demonstrates **professional-grade architecture** for ride-sharing or logistics apps.
- Shows how **Clean Architecture separates business logic from infrastructure**, improving flexibility.
- Provides a **template for scalable, maintainable, and testable systems** used in real-world fintech and mobility apps.
